Summary: Welcome to the Canvas LMS API Series


#Canvas LMS API Series

This blog will explain how to use the Canvas LMS API to update course content through building a CLI.  Content management using the Canvas website can be tedious and unnecessary.  Personally, I have wasted hours of time making the same change to each individual page in a course.  Using the Canvas API, it is possible to make mass changes to course content, and push changes directly to a Canvas course using terminal.
